# Sentinel-1 SAR Backscatter Analysis-Ready-Data Preparation in Google Earth Engine

## Introduction
The Sentinel-1 satellites provide temporally dense and high spatial resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The open data policy and global coverage of Sentinel-1 make it a valuable data source for a wide range of SAR-based applications. In this regard, Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a key platform for large area analysis with preprocessed Sentinel-1 backscatter images being available within few days after acquisition.  In this implementation, we present a framework for preparing Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter Analysis-Ready-Data in Google Earth Engine that implements additional border noise correction, speckle filtering and radiometric terrain normalization. The proposed framework can be used to generate Sentinel-1 Analysis-Ready-Data suitable for a wide range of land and inland water applications. The ARD preparation framework is implemented in Google Earth Engine JavaScript and Python API's.

This framework is intended for students and researchers, who are not experts in microwave remote sensing. It is intended to provide flexibility for a wide variety of large area land and inland water monitoring applications.


## Features
This framework generates an analysis-ready-data by applying three processing modules.
1. Addtional Border noise correction
2. Speckle Filtering 
   - Mono-temporal 
   - Multi-temporal 
3. Radiometric Terrain Normalization

The framework processes single (VV or VH) or dual (VV and VH) polarization data in either ascending, descending or both orbits at the same time. Results can be displayed and exported in the linear or dB scale.

## Usage
The details about parameter setting and their associated methods is described in the main script and accompanying technical note published in MDPI Remote sensing (link). 
The user should adjust the script path and GEE id to their own path and id before processing.

Here VV is in red,VH is in green and VV/VH is in blue.

## Dependencies
The JavaScript code runs in the GEE code editor with out installing additional packages. However, the python code requires the installation of<br/>
